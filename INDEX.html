    Hello! My name is Farha Saad. I live in Al-Mazra'a Al-Sharqiya and I am a graduate in Computer Engineering from Birzeit University
    I am 23 years old and passionate about enhancing my skills in programming and modern technology.
    I enjoy exploring innovative tech solutions, and I am particularly interested in learning more about artificial intelligence.
    In my free time, I love reading tech-related books and experimenting with small programming projects.
    My future goal is to work in a global tech company and contribute to the development of smart systems.
    Additionally, I aspire to create my own project focused on interactive educational applications for children.
